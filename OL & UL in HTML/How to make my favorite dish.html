    <h1>Gwyn's recipe for a good mashed potato</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg floury potatoes</li>
        <li>50g salted butter plus 1 tbsp</li>
        <li>50g whole milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <div style="width: 65%">
        <ol>
            <li style="padding: 10px">
                Tip the potatoes into a large pan, cover with cold water and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt. Set the
                pan over a high heat and bring to the boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 15-20
                mins until the potatoes are very tender â€“ they should be able to be easily pierced with the tip of a knife.
                Drain well, then return to the pan and leave to steam-dry for 5 mins.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 10px">
                Pass the potatoes through a ricer into a large bowl for a lump-free mash (you may need to do this in batches).
                Alternatively, mash with a potato masher until smooth, then press through a sieve using the back of a spoon
                to get rid of any remaining lumps.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 10px">
                Tip the 50g salted butter, the milk and some seasoning into the bowl with the hot mash.
                Beat everything together with a wooden spoon or spatula until the butter has
                melted and the mixture is smooth and creamy.
                Add a splash more milk to loosen, if needed. Top with the remaining 1 tbsp butter and leave
                it to melt for a few seconds before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
