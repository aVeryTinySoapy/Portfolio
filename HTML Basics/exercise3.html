                Hi! I'm Gwyn, a 2nd year college student. I am currently taking the course Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am a simple person. <br> I love cats. I am not very good at programming, but I do enjoy it though, and I will practice and try my very hardest to be able to say I'm good at it one day and will keep learning.
